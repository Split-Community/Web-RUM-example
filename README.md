Example showing usage of the Web RUM Agent


This is a very straighforward example using the Web RUM agent. 

1. On line 8 of `app.js` make sure to replace `SDK_KEY` with your client side SDK Key. 
2. install the required libraries with `npm install`
3. Finally, package with  `npx parcel index.html` and it will run on localhost:1234

You can use this to test and experiment with custom event collectors and see how the existing events are collected.
